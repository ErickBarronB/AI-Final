- **Location**: Leader tactical decision making
- **Implementation**:
  - `WeightedRouletteWheel.cs` - Generic weighted selection system
  - Used in `LeaderCommandState.MakeTacticalDecision()`

## 7. FLOCKING FOR ALL NPCs

### ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Location**: Steering behaviors system
- **Implementation**:
  - `SquadFlocking()` method in `SteeringBehaviors.cs`
  - Applied to all unit movement via `MoveTo()` method
  - Squad members flock around their leader
  - Independent units have minimal flocking behavior
- **Files**:
  - `Assets/Scripts/Movement/SteeringBehaviors.cs` - Flocking implementation (lines 80-100)
  - All movement states use `steering.MoveTo()` which includes flocking

---

## 8. OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE

- **Location**: Steering behaviors and pathfinding integration
- **Implementation**:
  - `ObstacleAvoidance()` method in `SteeringBehaviors.cs`
